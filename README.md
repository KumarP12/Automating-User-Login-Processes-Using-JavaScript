# Automating-User-Login-processes
TestCafe is an end-to-end testing framework for web applications that runs on Node.jsÂ¹. You can use TestCafe to simulate common user scenarios in major desktop browsers, cloud browsers, and on mobile devices.
To get started with TestCafe, you need to follow these basic steps:

- Install Node.js on your local machine. You can download it from [here].
- Install TestCafe globally from NPM (Node Package Manager) by running the following command: `npm install -g testcafe`
- Create a new test file with the `.js` or `.ts` extension and open it in your preferred text editor.
- Write your test code using the TestCafe API. You can find the documentation and guides [here].
- Run your test using the `testcafe` command with the desired browser and test file name as arguments. For example: `testcafe chrome login-test.js`

To write automated test cases for user login processes, you need to use the following TestCafe features:
The `fixture` and `test` keywords to define a test fixture and a test function. A fixture is a group of tests that share the same starting URL. A test function contains the test code that performs actions and assertions on the tested page.
